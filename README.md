# Mathematica Code Repository for Calculus Topics  
This repository contains Mathematica notebooks and corresponding PDFs on various calculus topics, 
including integral calculus, solids of revolution, and the Euler method. 
The codes are designed to help students and enthusiasts better understand these concepts through computational visualization and numerical methods.  
## Contents  
### 1. Integral Calculus   
* Explore the fundamental of integral such as Trapezoidal Rule and Simson's Rule.  
* Using integral to calculate drug assimilation.  
* [PDF](https://github.com/NDarayut/Mathematica_calc/blob/main/calculus_integral_project.pdf) with example and detailed solution.  
### 2. Solids of Revolution  
* Create and visualize 3D solids generated by rotating functions around axes.  
* Applications include calculating volumes of an asteroid.  
* [PDF](https://github.com/NDarayut/Mathematica_calc/blob/main/calculus_solid_of_revolution.pdf) with example and visualization.  
### 3. Euler Method  
* Implementation of Euler's method in comparison to the exact plot.  
* [PDF](https://github.com/NDarayut/Mathematica_calc/blob/main/calculus_euler_method.pdf) with example and visual comparison.
## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/NDarayut/Mathematica_calc```
2. Open the ```.nb``` files using Mathematica to explore the code and visualize the results.
3. PDF versions of the code are available in the repository for quick reference.
## Prerequisite  
* Wolfram Mathematica software to run the .nb files.  
* PDFs can be viewed using any standard PDF reader.
